# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# require 'factory_girl'
#
# FactoryGirl.create_list(:bar, 12, message: "Created 12 new bars")
# FactoryGirl.create_list(:user, 4, message: "Created 4 new users")
# FactoryGirl.create(:admin, message: "Created admin")
